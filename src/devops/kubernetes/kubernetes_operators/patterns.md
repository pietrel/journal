## Operator Pattern

The operator pattern is a design pattern used in Kubernetes to automate the management of complex applications. An operator is a piece of software that extends the functionality of Kubernetes by adding custom resources and controllers to manage the lifecycle of an application. Operators are used to automate tasks such as deployment, scaling, and monitoring of applications running on Kubernetes.
