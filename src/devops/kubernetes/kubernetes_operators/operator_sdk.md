# Operator SDK

The Operator SDK is a framework that enables developers to build Kubernetes operators using the Go programming language. The SDK provides a set of tools and libraries that simplify the development of operators by providing abstractions for common tasks such as watching resources, reconciling state, and interacting with the Kubernetes API.

The Operator SDK is built on top of the [Kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/) project, which provides a set of tools and libraries for building Kubernetes controllers. The SDK extends Kubebuilder by providing additional abstractions and tools that are specific to building operators.
