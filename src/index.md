# Welcome to my journal!

I created this page to collect and share my thoughts, experiments, and insights into the world of software engineering. The rust playground integration of the `mdbook` I used to generate this page makes exploring and testing ideas an especially enjoyable experience.

I hope you find something useful here. Enjoy your stay!
